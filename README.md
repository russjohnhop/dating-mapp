# What is this app?

In London especially, when you date someone they can be a significant distance away. It can be time consuming to research where to meet and what to do.

This application gives you the midpoint between you and your date so that you can easily and quickly plan what to do by meeting roughly halfway. This will be useful to me to save some time.

# Which technologies were used?

The majority of the code used is ReactJS and Tailwind. After some research, it seemed logical to use the Google Maps API to represent a pin between the two locations.

# How did the development process go?

I did initially plan the technologies used, but did not pay enough attention to planning whether the midpoint would use latitude and longitude or actually use transport times. I decided that figuring out equal transport times for both people was ideal, but had difficulty with the Transport For London API. It's great that it exists and has useful data, but I found the documentation and help available very hard to work with in comparison to the Google Maps JS API.
